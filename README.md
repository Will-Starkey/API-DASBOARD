This is my Final project for the JavaScript module. I have created an API fetch code that pulls up 8 different things ranging from images to flight data. I used the code that was provided for the .html and .css files but made some minor changes to style and information based on what I did and how I wanted it to look. For the .js I started with writing a fecth for the random dog image using aysnc functions and await responses. I also added math logic to select a random plane from a list of 100 that the api fetched, this allowed me to show a different plan everytime the "show one" button is clicked. I used copilot to help me clean up the code like we were show during this module in the recored videos.
